You Are My Sunshine
By Norman Blake

Sunshine, you may find my window                                        You are my sunshine,
But you won't find me                                                   My only sunshine,
And sunshine, I've got my friend of darkness here                       You make me happy
Tonight to hide me.                                                     When skies are gray.

So sunshine, as far as I'm concerned                                    You'll never know dear,
I'm where I want to be                                                  How much I love you --
And sunshine, as far as you're concerned                                Please don't take
Don't be concerned for me.                                              My sunshine away.

Cause she doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want me, Lord
She doesn't need me anymore
She grew tired of chasing rainbows
But I loved her true
And God you know I tried.

And I guess she was right
Cause I'm at the end
I found the part but there's no golden sun.

So sunshine, can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
And sunshine, pick up your dawn
And move on down the street.
